       "  Problems involving natural language understanding, generation, summarization, translation, or extraction are good candidates.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Requires contextual understanding:**  \n",
       "  Tasks that need understanding nuances, tone, or context in text can benefit from LLMs.\n",

       "- **Not purely numerical or rule-based:**  \n",
